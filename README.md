TODO: complete abstract GA implementation for creatures. Add concretes for traits.

Age of creature = generations

	 i.e. Older creatures have more extreme matching to environment

	traitArray corresponding to given trait set
	  [canFly = 8,
	  canJump = 2] etc ...
	  
	
	biome = hills
	
	type = isTallTerrain
	
	creature {
	
	
	canJump = 5
	
	
	canFly = 2
	
	
	}
	
	
	if tallTerrain {
	
	
	  canFly*5 = 10
	
	
	  canJump*3 = 15
	
	
	}
	
	mobility fitness score = 25

	primary locomotion isJump

 etc ...
